Ahmed Magdy et al. [10] utilized dermoscopic photos from the ISIC collection to propose and evaluate two skin cancer classification approaches. They conducted preprocessing operations such as scaling, filtering, and hair removal, followed by feature extraction using texture and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features. While deep learning (DL) via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved an accuracy of 97.75%, machine learning (ML) classifiers yielded accuracies ranging from 64.92% to 81.25%. Moreover, novel techniques like KNN-PDNN and AlexGWO surpassed previous methods, achieving accuracies exceeding 99%. The study suggests future research directions focusing on dynamic lesion development analysis and utilizing diverse datasets for improved prediction. The presented models exhibit promise for practical use in dermatology.
